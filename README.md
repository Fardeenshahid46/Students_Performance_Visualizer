# Students_Performance_Visualizer
Top Students Visualizer is a Python-based data analysis and visualization project that highlights the academic performance of students using Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib for visualization. The project reads data from a CSV file containing student names and their marks in three subjects: Math, English, and Science.

The program calculates the average score for each student by taking the mean of the three subject scores. Once the averages are computed, it sorts the students based on their overall performance and extracts the top 5 performers with the highest average marks.

To make the data more insightful and visually appealing, the project generates a bar chart showing the names of the top 5 students along with their average scores. This visual representation provides a quick and effective way to identify high-achieving students, which can be useful for educators, parents, or academic reporting.

The final chart is saved as an image file (top_students.png), making it easy to share or include in presentations. This project serves as a great example of how basic data science techniques can be applied to educational data to gain meaningful insights.
